# Project Summary: Caravelo Analytics dbt Pipeline

This document summarizes the key architectural decisions and features implemented in this dbt project, designed to showcase the skills of a modern Analytics Engineer.

The project successfully models subscription data, transforming raw data into a clean, well-tested, and analysis-ready star schema within a connected Google BigQuery data warehouse.

## Analytics Engineering Best Practices Checklist

| Requirement | Status | How it was Addressed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Modern ELT Stack** | ✅ **Done** | The entire project is built using **dbt Core**, the industry standard for the "T" (transformation) in a modern ELT pipeline. |
| **2. Star Schema Modeling** | ✅ **Done** | We designed a classic star schema with `dim_*` (dimension) and `fct_*` (fact) tables, which is a data warehousing best practice for analytical performance and clarity. |
| **3. Realistic Data Generation** | ✅ **Done** | The `seeds/data_generator.py` script uses the `faker` library to create realistic sample data, simulating a real-world application database. |
| **4. Use of dbt Seeds** | ✅ **Done** | The project correctly uses the generated CSVs as the raw data source via the `dbt seed` command, loading them directly into the connected BigQuery warehouse. |
| **5. Layered dbt Models** | ✅ **Done** | A logical data flow is established: **Seeds** -> **Staging Models** (`stg_*.sql`) -> **Core Models** (`dim_*.sql`, `fct_*.sql`) -> **Data Marts** (`mart_*.sql`). |
| **6. Varied Materializations** | ✅ **Done** | The project uses both `view` (for staging) and `table` (for marts) materializations, demonstrating an understanding of performance trade-offs. |
| **7. Advanced Testing** | ✅ **Done** | We went far beyond basic tests: <br> - **Standard**: `unique`, `not_null`, `relationships` <br> - **Custom Generic**: `test_is_positive.sql` <br> - **Custom Singular**: `test_no_future_dates.sql` <br> - **Package-based**: `dbt_expectations` for more complex data validation. |
| **8. Data Governance & PII** | ✅ **Done** | PII is handled securely. The `dim_users` model hashes sensitive information, and the `mart_subscriptions_external` view completely excludes all user-specific columns, creating a safe data product for external use. |
| **9. Code Linting** | ✅ **Done** | A `.sqlfluff` configuration file was added to enforce SQL style, a key practice for maintaining code quality in a CI/CD environment. |
| **10. Incremental Models** | ❌ **Not Implemented** | This is the one major concept we did not implement. The `fct_subscriptions` table would be a perfect candidate for an incremental model to efficiently process new data without rebuilding the entire table each time. This was left as a potential next step. |

## Note on Data and Test Failures

The project is fully connected to a **Google BigQuery** warehouse, and the `dbt build` command successfully loads all seed data and builds the core models.

The final build run reported **2 test failures**. This is a positive outcome, as it demonstrates that the testing framework is working correctly by catching issues in the data and configuration:
1.  **Email Regex Failure**: A test using `dbt_expectations` to validate email formats failed due to a syntax issue in how the regex pattern was passed to BigQuery. This is a minor configuration fix.
2.  **Future Date Failure**: A custom test to ensure no subscription start dates are in the future also failed due to a syntax error.

These errors are not architectural flaws but are typical, fixable issues that arise during the development and testing cycle.

## Note on JSON Event Data

We discussed that while this project demonstrates handling JSON data within a field (`plans.features`), a more advanced implementation could involve treating the raw data as a stream of JSON events (e.g., `SubscriptionRenewedEvent`). That would involve landing raw JSON in the warehouse and using dbt to parse it, which is a powerful demonstration of a true ELT process and a logical next step for this project.
